Thank you for viewing my profile. After 3 years of owning a domain, now is the time to get serious. 

## Intro:
I am Kanch. I am a self acknowledged technology addict. Curious about many things on cloud/ML currently. In my day job, I work in helping customers innovate with cloud through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

## Intention for this blog:
This blog is intended to be my personal learning experience as I navigate this ever changing cloud race. Learning is a marathon and not a sprint. Learning is best served when we teach. My goal is to keep this as active as possible. Here some feedback and fine tune.

## Interests:
My interests lie in a broad spectrum of AI.\
          `Democratizing AI` `MLOps` `Business use cases` `Kaggle`

## Contact:
Please feel free to reach out to me for any questions - kanch@cloudrace.info
