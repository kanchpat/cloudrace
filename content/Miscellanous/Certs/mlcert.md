Extremely excited in achieving ML Engineering certification as I embark on my AI/ML journey with Google Cloud. There is not a lot of material available while preparing for this certification as the exam is released less than a month ago.

[Study guide](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/machine-learning-engineer) has most of the content on what to focus on. This exam is for ML Engineers. I would suggest anyone planning to take the exam first pursue the [Data Engineering Exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer)(Prep content [here](https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer)) as the focus is more on data.

Key topics to focus on
----

* Orchestration of the Machine Learning life cycle
* Data Pre-processing, preparation and options
* Feature Engineering strategies
* Training and Deploying techniques , options - Pros and Cons
* ML Ops and its workflow
* Spectrum of options available - API, Auto ML , DIY and AI Platform
* Understanding Gradient Descent, Loss , Regularization
* High level understanding of Regression, Classification, Clustering, CNN, DNN, RNN

I used the below preparation contents. Hope it is of some help to you. Good luck with your exam. And thank you to the folks who helped me in identifying the key areas to focus on.

[Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) - Google - MUST read even if you are not taking the exam

Have a good understanding of Google Cloud Services - Data prep, Data fusion, Data flow, Composer, API, Auto ML, AI Platform (all features), Bigquery ML
